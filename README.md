# BeTheChange

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.3.

## BeTheChange
I divided the project in two parts, Frontend and Backend applications, both running as individual entiites.

For the backend, I used Java Spring Boot and Postgres Database.

For the Frontend I used Angular, Bootstrap and few more npm modules.

Run `npm install` in frontend directory, to install all dependencies.

Run `npm start` in frontend directory to start the frontend application and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`



The frontend application is deployed on Netlify and the backend application is deployed on Heroku (because Netlify does not support Java applications).

If the application is not accessed for a long period of time, the next time you access it, you have to wait for a certain period of time(15-20s) for the application to be "awakened".
